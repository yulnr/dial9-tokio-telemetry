# Agent Guidelines

- You MUST use Red/Green TDD.
- BEFORE COMMITING: `cargo nextest run --stress-duration 20s`. The package has no flaky tests. If you find a flaky test, you created it.
- **JS/HTML-only changes** (no `.rs` files touched, no trace format changes): you do NOT need to run the full Rust test suite or the stress test. Run the relevant JS tests under `dial9-viewer/ui/test_*.js` with `node <test>` and a quick `cargo build -p dial9-viewer` to confirm `rust-embed` picks up any new files. Skip `cargo nextest` / stress run.

## API Design

This is a published library with backwards compatibility requirements. Follow
these rules for all public APIs:

- **Use builders for all configuration.** Never use positional arguments for
  config that may grow. Use `#[bon::builder]` (v3) to derive builders.
- **All builder fields should be private** with setter methods, so we can add
  fields without breaking changes.
- **Prefer `impl Into<String>` over `&str`** in builder setters for ergonomics.
- **Non-required fields must have defaults.** New fields added later must be
  optional or defaulted to avoid breaking existing callers.
- **Mark config structs `#[non_exhaustive]`** if not using `#[bon::builder]`,
  so adding fields is not a breaking change.
- **Think about semver hazards:** adding a required parameter, removing a
  public type, or changing a trait signature are all breaking. When in doubt,
  keep it private or behind a builder.

## Trace Format Backwards Compatibility

The trace format uses a self-describing schema: each event type's schema is
written to the wire before any events of that type. Decoders use the schema on
the wire (not a compiled-in schema) to decode events.

**Rules:**

1. **Adding new fields is always safe** — even non-optional ones. The decoder
   reads whatever fields the schema declares. Old traces simply won't have the
   new field in their schema, so it won't appear in the decoded output.

2. **Removing non-optional fields is NOT safe.** Old traces that contain the
   field will still declare it in their on-wire schema, and the decoder will
   attempt to read it.

3. **We only care about the JS decoder reading old traces.** Users always have
   a current decoder (the viewer), but may load old trace files. When you add a
   new non-optional field, the JS viewer code that accesses it must handle the
   field being `undefined` (because old traces won't have it):

   ```js
   // Good — gracefully handles old traces missing the field
   const workerId = v.worker_id != null ? num(v.worker_id) : undefined;

   // Bad — will throw or produce NaN on old traces
   const workerId = num(v.worker_id);
   ```

4. **Rust decoder backwards compat is not a concern.** We don't need to worry
   about old Rust decoders reading new traces.

## Coding practices

**Never use `unwrap_or(0)`, `unwrap_or_default()`, or similar "fallback to
zero/sentinel" patterns.** These hide bugs by silently producing plausible but
wrong values. Always consider the actual error condition: propagate the error,
return `Option`, log and skip, or panic if the invariant is truly unrecoverable.

Avoid dropping an error without logging it. Use `tracing` for logging.
```
let _ = ...
```

**ALWAYS rate-limit logging that can fire from a loop or repeated error path.** Any `warn!`/`error!` reachable from a background task loop, retry loop, or per-request hot path MUST be wrapped in `rate_limited!`:
```rust
rate_limited!(Duration::from_secs(60), {
    tracing::warn!("...: {e}");
});
```
Unguarded logging in loops causes log spam that degrades observability and can itself become a performance problem. One-time paths (startup, shutdown, per-thread init) are exempt.

## Running tests

- Always run `cargo nextest run` to run tests
- Shuttle tests are NOT included in `cargo nextest run`. They require a separate invocation: `./scripts/test-shuttle.sh`. Always run this when modifying code under `#[cfg(all(test, shuttle))]` or the flush/source paths.

## Ownership

- You own all code you are working on. There is no such thing as a "pre-existing failure" or something that is "not your problem." If you see a warning or failure, fix it.

## Pre-commit checks

- You MUST run `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` before every commit. Both must be clean.
- **Preserve doc comments and inline comments.** Before presenting a PR, diff your changes and verify you have not accidentally deleted documentation comments (`///`, `//!`), inline explanatory comments (`//`), or module-level docs. Refactors that move code must carry all associated comments with it.

## Demo Trace

If you modify the trace format (event structure, encoding, parser, etc.), you MUST regenerate the demo trace:

```bash
./scripts/regenerate_demo_trace.sh
```

Or via Docker (no host Rust/AWS/Java needed — DDB Local runs as a sidecar):

```bash
./scripts/regenerate_demo_trace_docker.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
rm -f dial9-viewer/ui/demo-trace.bin
cargo build --release -p metrics-service
AWS_PROFILE=your-profile cargo run --release -p metrics-service --bin metrics-service -- --trace-path sched-trace.bin --demo
cp sched-trace.*.bin dial9-viewer/ui/demo-trace.bin
git add dial9-viewer/ui/demo-trace.bin
git commit -m "Regenerate demo trace after format changes"
```

The demo trace is used for:
- Live demos on the hosted viewer
- Documentation screenshots
- Testing the viewer with real data

Failing to update it will cause the viewer to fail when loading the demo.

## Meta

- Never declare done after pushing or opening a PR until CI is green. Check CI status and fix any failures before moving on.
- **Do not stack PRs** (PR B targeting PR A's branch). The merge queue rewrites commits, so stacked PRs always end up with merge conflicts. Instead, wait for the first PR to merge, then rebase the second onto `main`.

## Ways of working
- After finishing your work use showboat to demonstrate what you have done. include key code, tests, and what was changed.
- Use a progress doc to keep track of what you are doing. progress docs are just for you. when we are ready for PR, we unstage the progress docs
